# clickTracker
ClickTracker is a Firefox Extension which can be used to track all the clicks performed in a browser during a session.

I got the inspiration for this project from timetravelling humans. I am joking.

While working with my previous company (With Remote Location), I always felt that with steps (to reach to a specific app state), if I could provide a screenshot containing all the buttons on which I had clicked to reach to a specific state than that would be surely helpful in having a better and efficient communication.

ClickTracker does the same.

1) User performs few clicks inside the web app.
2) Click Tracker records all of them.
3) User click over any element in clickTracker.
4) Click Tracker assigns the same color to web app element as it has assigned to the element in web extension.


### To run the ClickTracker in local machine.
1) Download the Repo.
2) Open about:debugging in Firefox.
3) Click Load Temporary Add-on.
4) Open manifest.json file.

App icon is taken from

Future updates can have
1) Improving app code by removing unwanted code.
2) Including a share feature to share clickTracker information to another clickTracker user.

Happy Coding!
